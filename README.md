# Zaidimas_KasKurKada-Telegram-Bot

This program is a chatbot that has built in some other features like: the game called - KasKurKada, it can show users information and being a chat bot - chat.
Chatbot at the start of the program checks the default language of the user and according to it chats with user that language. Chatbot knows Russian and 
Lithuanian/English languages. But bot has the function to change the language if the user wants to. Also then the user starts the bot, bot sends message to the 
admin of he bot, that the user whos name is that and that have started the bot. Vocabulary of the bot is restricted to greetings and answering some simple 
questions like: how do you do, whats your name and similar.  

Program is based on three ConversationHandlers. The first one is main - it runs the whole program. The other two are for the game. 

Also wanted to make the bot funny, so it has mean character like Bender from Futurama.
